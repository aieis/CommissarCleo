* Commissar Cleo Mod

This is a fun mod that gives Cleopatra all the "positive" traits of
other civs and leaders.

* Install

Copy the "CommissarCleoMod" directory to
"Documents/My Games/Sid Meier's Civilization VI/Mods/"

Create the parent directories if you have to (you shouldn't).

* Credits

The mod is based on the following mod:

It was built using the Firaxis ModBuddy. The source directory is
"CommissarCleo", you should be able to launch the project with
ModBuddy using the supplide *.civ6proj file.

I found the following resource a good place to start:

* Modifications

You should be able to edit the ./CommisarCleo/traits.sql to fit any
leader without ModBuddy.
